# Recipes Changed Since 1.7.5

This file lists recipe changes in 1.7.6 that may affect your setups or patterns.

**Note that this doesn't include new alternative recipes, new recipes, or deprecated recipes (where the original still exists, but a new, cheaper version has been added)**

## Both Modes

### Extended Crafting
**Large Widespread Breaking Change:**

Extended Crafting recipes are now 'strict'!    
This means that large table recipes (5x5, 7x7, 9x9) now MUST be performed in the table of the exact tier!    
E.g., you can no longer do Elite recipes in an Ultimate table!

### GregTech Cell Crafting, Bender, Extruder and Assembler Recipes
**Output Buff**

All outputs have been increased by 4x.

### ME Conduit Recipe
**Output Nerf**

Crafting recipe output amount nerfed from 4 to 1; assembler recipe output amount nerfed from 8 to 2. Use normal ME Glass Cables instead; only use ME Conduits when required.

### Netherrack Dust Centrifuging

### Endstone Maceration
**Output Change**

Adds a chanced output for a Tiny Pile of Enderpearl Dust, at 5% (+1.2% per tier).

### Beam Former Recipe
**Complete Recipe Change**

Changed from a complex, expensive assembler recipe at EV to a simple crafting recipe needing 8 glass cables and 1 fluix pearl.

### Wireless Connector Recipe
**Small Input Change**

AE2 Wireless Receiver changed to GregTech Wireless Transmitter (late MV instead of mid EV), and two Pure Fluix Crystals changed to Beam Formers.

## Hard Mode

### Charger Recipe
**Small Input Change**

Dark Steel Plates changed to Black Steel Plates. This properly signifies that AE2 is gated behind Black Steel; as opposed to confusion if its required for the Crystal Growth Chamber instead.

### Crystal Growth Chamber Recipe
**Small Input Change**

Blue Steel Frames changed to Black Steel Frames. This moves AE2 a little earlier.

### Endstone Centrifusion
**Voltage Change**

Changed from EV to IV. Use microminer ores as your earliest source of tungsten instead.

### Snowchestite Ore Maceration
**Output Change**

Chanced output changed from Chalcopyrite to Caesium. This should help make Snowchestite Processing be Caesium positive instead of a Caesium sink.

### Snowchestite Ore Washing
**Output Change**
